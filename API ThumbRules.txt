Rule
-----------
First you have to check whether Get API response data is in
object or array format. 

1. if it is in plain object format then it is very easy to get the 
value from the object by using that particular object property.
please see kanyeAPI example.

2. if it is in array format that means array of object . then 
you have to run a for loop for this array to get the elements of this 
array which is individually an object element . then you have to 
use that particular object property to get the desiered value . 
PLease see the jasonplaceholderAPI example.

3. if it is in object that means object of array . and your desired
value existed in that array then first you have to select that 
object property which contains the array . then run a for loop for
this array to get the elements of this array . then use the inner
object property of that array element to get the desired value.
PLease see the exxample of randomusersAPI .
